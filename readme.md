# Bidding Methods Comparison with AB Test


## Business Problem

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type called 'average bidding' as an alternative to the existing 'maximum bidding.' One of our clients, X company, decided to test this new feature and initiated an A/B test to understand whether average bidding brings more conversions compared to maximum bidding.

The A/B test has been ongoing for one month, and X company is now looking for you to analyze the results. The ultimate success metric for X company is 'Purchase.' Therefore, the focus should be on the 'Purchase' metric for statistical tests.
